        <h1>Overview</h1>

        <p>In "Unequal Exposure to Ecological Hazards: Environmental Injustices in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts," Daniel R. Faber and Eric J. Krieg report that low-income communities in Massachusetts with high concentrations of non-white residents are much more likely to include sites that present environmental threats to human health.  By providing a more detailed portrait of a few of the communities included in Faber and Kreig's study, this essay will explore the social and political factors involved in creating theseenvironmental inequalities. </p>

		<p>According to a 1987 study, “[t]hree of every five African Americans and Latinos nationwide live in comunties that have illegal or abandoned toxic dumps.” (Faber, 3) “Communities with one hazardous waste facility have twice the percentage of people of color as those with none, and the percentage triples in communities with two or more waste sites.” (Faber, 3) A follow-up study in 1994 found that people of color were 47% more likely than whites to live near one of these toxic dumps. (Faber, 3) </p>

		<p>Landfills are another source of environmental pollution. They have the potential to pollute water supplies, pollute the air through incinerators, and contain cancer-causing compounds. Faber's study found that while 50.8% of towns are low income, they are home to 58.9% of all incinerator ash landfills, 66.7% of all demolition landfills, 71.4% of all illegal sites, 74.5% of all sludge landfills, 69.5% of all tire piles, and 58.9% of all transfer stations (Faber, 5) He also found that communities where people of color were less than 5% of the population averaged 0.13 landfills per square mile while communities where people of color make up 25% or more of the population averaged 0.36 landfills per square mile. That is a three times higher rate of landfills for communities of color. </p>
