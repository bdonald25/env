        <h1>Social/Political Factors</h1>
        <h2><u>Lower oposition to toxic waste</u><h2>

        <p>One possible explanation for why environmental inequality occurs is because lower socio-economic areas are less likely to oppose environmentally hazardous sites. “A 1984 report by Cerrell Associates for the California Waste Management Board, for instance, openly recommended that polluting industries and the state locate hazardous waste facilities in 'lower socio-economic neighborhoods' because those communities had a much lower likelihood of offering political opposition” (Fabar, 3)</p>

        <p>In this case, the government board is openly taking advantage of the fact that the poor has too many other problems to spend their time opposing a hazardous site. The government should protect all its people equally, not openly recommend that industries take advantage of its more vulnerable citizens.</p>

        <p>Charles Blow writes about a similar instance of the government treating poor minority citizens different in the NY Times article “Inequality in the Air We Breath”. In the town of Gibsland, Louisiana, a munitions plant that closed down left untreated explosives for 40 years on in their sites. The explosives have contaminated the area and the EPA has conducted an emergency plan to burn 15 million pounds of M6 explosives. Robert Flournoy, an enviornmental toxicologist and former Lousiana Tech professor has spoke out against this plan, stating that it is not safe and the EPA has not released any data to suggest otherwise.</p>

        <p>Blow asks “Can we imagine anyone, with a straight face, proposing to openly burn millions of pounds of explosives near Manhattan or Seattle?”  This unequal treatment of low-income, minority towns such as Gibsland is a form of environmental racism in Charles Bow's eyes and in this incident it does appear that the EPA is treating this town of poor minority citizens different than it would a rich white community.</p>
