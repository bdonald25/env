    		<p>A 1987 study found that &quot;[t]hree of every five African Americans and Latinos nationwide live in comunties that have illegal or abandoned toxic dumps.&quot; (Faber, 3) &quot;Communities with one hazardous waste facility have twice the percentage of people of color as those with none, and the percentage triples in communities with two or more waste sites.&quot; (Faber, 3) A follow-up study in 1994 found that people of color were 47% more likely than whites to live near one of these toxic dumps. (Faber, 3) Residents living close to hazardous waste sites have been shown to have increased risks of health problems that include a range of diseases, including cancer. These problems are further amplified for the more vulnerable populations such as young children. </p> 

        <p>In a perfect world, we would eliminate the use of all toxic chemicals in favor of safer alternatives to eliminate the need for new waste sites, while also cleaning up all existing sites. Both of these issues will most likely not be eliminated completely in the near future, due to costs of clean ups and the lack of safer alternatives to some chemicals, so we need to at least keep our government accountable of the locations for any new sites as well as push for cleanups of current sites. The issue of inequality comes from the initial placement of these sites and that is where the government should be held most accountable in the future. The cleaning up of these sites should not be done in a way that favors minorities in an attempt to balance the percentages because the government has a responsibility to stop all pollution combating one equality with another in an attempt to even out the statistics would be a contradiction. The problem exists, we should prevent new sites from further exploiting minorities, but we should clean up all sites equally and not favor one ethnic group over another in the cleanup efforts. </p>

    		<p>Landfills are another source of environmental pollution. They have the potential to pollute water supplies, air through incinerators, and potentially contain cancer-causing compounds that nearby residents can be unknowingly exposed to. Faber's study found that while 50.8% of towns are what they considered to be low income, they are home to 58.9% of all incinerator ash landfills, 66.7% of all demolition landfills, 71.4% of all illegal sites, 74.5% of all sludge landfills, 69.5% of all tire piles, and 58.9% of all transfer stations (Faber, 5) He also found that communities where people of color were less than 5% of the population averaged 0.13 landfills per square mile while communities where people of color make up 25% or more of the population averaged 0.36 landfills per square mile. That is a three times higher rate of landfills for communities of color. </p>

        <p>This issue should be fixed in the same ways that I mentioned above for hazardous waste sites, by holding the government accountable for locations of new sites. Landfills do not have the same potential to be eliminated as hazardous waste sites because we as a society will cannot realistically eliminate our waste output. As individuals we can attempt to lower our trash output and also improve our recycling habits, which may lower the number of new landfills that are created but the real underlying issue is the governmentâ€™s placement of the sites. Now that we are have this problem, we should attempt to prevent it from becoming worse as we go forward, but we should not put in place a system that targets majority groups in an attempt to even out the statistics. The focus should instead be placed on preventing waste in landfills from harming nearby residents, while also putting in place a system that prevents the government from further taking advantage of minority citizens.</p>

    		<p>One in ten white children have asthma, one in nine Latino children have asthma, and one in six black children have asthma. (Keith Rushing) It is clear from this statistic that minorities are disproportunatly affected from greater exposure to air pollution. Barack Obama's daughter, Malia, is one of those children who have asthma. Barack Obama himself, recently said that it is linked to air pollution. Asthma is a growing problem that kills about nine people every day. &quot;Although just 5.4% of all communities in the state are communities where people of color compose 15% or more of the population, they are home to 18.2% of all active power plants and 23.4% of all proposed power plants in the state. &quot; (Faber, 7)</p>

        <p>Asthma is largely linked to air pollution. The above statistics give a strong indication of the unequal exposure that minority groups have to asthma. Air pollution can originate from a variety of different sources including incinerators to power plants, both of which minorities have an unequal exposure to. Air pollution also comes from other sources such as vehicles which people living in urban areas would tend to have higher exposure to due to the increased density of vehicles in the area. Ideally, air pollution could be completely eliminated by moving to alternative fuels and electric vehicles. One explanation for the unequal exposure for minority groups is that urban areas tend to have worse air equality, and urban areas also tend to have higher minority groups than suburban areas. It is not necessarily an issue that minorities tend to have higher populations in urban areas, but it could be an explanation for the higher exposure to polluted air. Therefore, the solution going forward should be to move to cleaner power sources and vehicles which would potentially eliminate the issue of poor air quality in urban areas. That alone should balance out the inequality minorities are facing. To illustrate this point, Beijing banned all of its cars from driving for fourteen days in an attempt to clear up the smog for a parade, below is the before and after pictures to show how much pollution can be eliminated by removing vehicle pollution.</p>

        <p>Charles Blow gives light environmental inequallity by writing about a current event taking place now in Louisiana in the NY Times article &quot;Inequality in the Air We Breath&quot;. In the town of Gibsland, Louisiana, a munitions plant that closed down left untreated explosives for 40 years on in their sites. The explosives have contaminated the area and the EPA has conducted an emergency plan to burn 15 million pounds of M6 explosives. Robert Flournoy, an environmental toxicologist and former Lousiana Tech professor has spoke out against this plan, stating that it is not safe and the EPA has not released any data to suggest otherwise.</p>

        <p>Blow asks &quot;Can we imagine anyone, with a straight face, proposing to openly burn millions of pounds of explosives near Manhattan or Seattle?&quot;  This unequal treatment of low-income, minority towns such as Gibsland is a form of environmental racism in Charles Bow's eyes and in this incident it does appear that the EPA is treating this town of poor minority citizens different than it would a rich white community.</p>
